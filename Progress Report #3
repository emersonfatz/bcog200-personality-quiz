Concept rating 
- 10/10
- The idea for our project is fully fleshed out and created. We knew pretty early on what we wanted to do as far as the personality quiz went and the different UIUC arcetypes we wanted to create.
  Our questions have been fully drafted and complete. 

File Structure
- 8/10 
- We have different files for each part of our project such as questions and code. As we get furhter into the details and design of our final code I presume that we will add more files and continue
  to tweak the ones we have already craeted. 

Project Description 
- 10/10
- This has been looked at and updated to represent our current project standing. It has also been updated via the suggestions we recieved on our first few project updates. 

Approach
- 9/10
- A lot of the algorithms and approaches we have chosen to impliment into our project, such as image design and a quiz type structure have been done before in a different way through homework one
  and homework two. The is not much beyond the design factors that we are implimenting into our code, that go beyond the information available and taught to us via the textbook. 

Project Code
- 4/10
- While we have the baisc layout of function needed for our code and conditionals, there is still a lot of work to do as far as blending it all together into one coherent and running piece
  of code

Code Style 
- 7.5/10 
- For now our code is pretty organized but we could definitly do a better job at writing comments to demonstarte our line of thinking. Working in a group project is different than just working on labs
  alone so there is a greater need to explaining our trian of thought. But as far as names and line spacing go, we are doing a pretty good job. 

Code Documentation
- 3/10
- I kind of explained this above but we could definitly do a better job of implementing this into our code

Code Tests
-0/10
- we haev yet to add these or work out how to include them
